<h1>The BEST movies according to Liat</h1>

<hr>

<h2>My top 3 of this year are:</h2>

<h3> Inside Out 2 </h3>
<p>
It make me remember when I was her age, and bring so much feelings to flower.<br>
Its amazing how this movie make you understand that all that you feel is NORMAL.<br>
No matter what is what you feel. And that its amazing not being a teenager anymore!
</p>

<h3> Gladiator </h3>
<p> 
I neever saw this movie till this week, its amazing how was the effects made at that years,<br>
the movie is amazing, a lot of things happening, fight, honor, values, fear and history.<br>
Its not a true story, but its not far for the real world, and its amazing how this is still<br>
relevant.
</p>

<h3>Moana </h3>
<p> 
As you see im trying to catch up for the 2 parts of old movies, I wanted to show "Moana" <br>
to my husband, he never so the movie and he love animated ones, I think this movie shows<br>
how everithing is posible and you just need to belive in yourself and be surrounded with<br>
people that will push you to be better.
